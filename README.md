# Weather Data Analytics Project 

This project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing weather data. It is designed to parse, store, and analyze weather information from various locations, focusing on temperature and wind speed metrics.

## Description

This Java-based project is built to manage and analyze extensive weather data. It involves parsing CSV files containing weather statistics like average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, wind speed, and more, for different cities and states. The application allows users to retrieve weather data in various ways, such as finding the maximum and minimum temperatures across states, identifying states with specific temperature readings, and determining the warmest and coldest cities. It’s an excellent tool for meteorologists, climate researchers, or anyone interested in weather patterns.

## Getting Started

* Java JDK 8 or newer.
* A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional, but recommended for ease of use).
* The weather data CSV file in the specified format.
* Operating System: Compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.


### Installing

* Clone the repository or download the source code from [source code repository URL].
* Ensure the CSV file with weather data is in the project's root directory, or modify the FILE_NAME constant in WeatherDataController.java to point to your CSV file’s location.

### Executing program

* Open the project in your Java IDE or navigate to the project's directory in the command line.
* Compile the project. In IDEs, this is usually done automatically.
* Run WeatherDataController.java. This will start the program.
* The program displays a menu with various options to interact with the weather data. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through these options.
